# AmesHousing-dataset_Regression-Diagnostics-with-R
Implementing Regression Diagnostics on AmesHousing  dataset in R

I used a data set called AmesHousing that examines features of houses sold in Ames during the 
2006-2010 timeframe. The goal is to use the training data to predict the sale prices of the 
houses. The data set has 2930 rows and 82 variables. there are both numerical and character 
type variables in my data set. 
I want to use Regression Diagnostics to answer the following question:

1- Which parameters affect the sale price of the house? (By which parameters we can predict the 
sale price of the house)?
2-When were the most houses built? 
3-In what condition are the most houses on the market?
4-Does the sale price affected by the quality of material and garage area, living area, 1 st floor area, 
year built, and full bath?
